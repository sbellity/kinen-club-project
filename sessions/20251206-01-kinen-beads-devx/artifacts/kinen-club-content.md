## What is Kinen?

### The Problem

Working with AI is powerful but often frustrating:
- **Context disappears** — Every conversation starts from scratch
- **Thinking is shallow** — AI jumps to solutions without exploring the problem
- **Decisions are lost** — No trail of why choices were made
- **Knowledge fragments** — Insights scattered across chat logs

### The Solution

Kinen provides:

1. **Structured Sessions** — Round-based exploration that goes deep before going wide
2. **Persistent Memory** — Your decisions, patterns, and insights remembered across conversations
3. **Semantic Search** — Find past thinking by meaning, not just keywords
4. **Living Documents** — Specifications that evolve with your understanding

## The Kinen Methodology

### How Sessions Work

```
Round 1: Foundation
├── Establish goals and constraints
├── Ask exploratory questions
└── Identify key tensions

Round 2: Refinement
├── Dive deeper into interesting areas
├── Resolve contradictions
└── Explore alternatives

Round 3: Architecture
├── Make concrete decisions
├── Design components
└── Consider tradeoffs

Round 4: Integration
├── How parts work together
├── Edge cases and errors
└── User experience

Round 5: Details
├── Concrete examples
├── Remaining questions
└── Implementation priorities

Round 6: Summary
├── Document all decisions
├── Capture rationale
└── Define next steps
```

### Why Rounds Matter

**Without structure:**
- AI gives you the first answer that seems right
- You don't explore alternatives
- Hidden assumptions go unchallenged
- Decisions lack documented rationale

**With Kinen rounds:**
- Each round goes deeper than the last
- Options are presented with clear tradeoffs
- AI challenges your assumptions constructively
- Every decision has documented reasoning

## The Science Behind Kinen

### Inspired by How Brains Actually Work

Kinen's architecture draws from neuroscience research:

**Memory Consolidation**
- Just like sleep helps your brain process information, Kinen "consolidates" your sessions
- Important ideas are strengthened, noise is filtered out
- Connections between distant concepts are discovered

**Active Forgetting**
- Your brain actively forgets irrelevant information
- Kinen does too — it maintains what matters and lets the rest fade
- This keeps search results relevant and fast

**Multiple Perspectives**
- Your brain stores memories with emotional, spatial, and factual tags
- Kinen indexes knowledge through multiple "lenses"
- Find information by cause-effect, methodology, or general similarity

### The Free Energy Principle

Kinen uses principles from Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle:

> "Intelligent systems minimize surprise by building better models of their world."

This means Kinen:
- Learns what you care about from your feedback
- Prioritizes information that reduces your uncertainty
- Adapts to your thinking patterns over time

```

### Daily Workflow

1. **Start with intent** — What do you want to explore?
2. **Let rounds unfold** — Answer questions, challenge ideas
3. **Track decisions** — Living documents capture your choices
4. **Search your memory** — Find past thinking when you need it
5. **Close with summary** — Capture the journey for future you

## FAQ

### How is Kinen different from just chatting with AI?

Chat is ephemeral and shallow. Kinen provides structure (rounds), persistence (memory), and documentation (artifacts). Your thinking accumulates instead of disappearing.

### Do I need to be technical to use Kinen?

No. The methodology works in any AI chat interface. Technical users can use the CLI and MCP for deeper integration.

### What AI tools does Kinen work with?

Kinen works with any AI that supports conversation. Full integration (MCP) is available for Cursor, Claude Desktop, and compatible tools.

### Where is my data stored?

Locally by default. Your sessions are markdown files in a folder you control. Optional cloud sync available for Pro users.

### Can I use Kinen for my team?

Yes. Team spaces let multiple people contribute to the same knowledge base. Git integration keeps everything versioned.

## Testimonials

> "Kinen changed how I work with AI. Instead of hoping Claude remembers context, I know it does. Instead of repeating myself, I build on past work."
> — *Developer, San Francisco*

> "The round-based methodology forced me to think deeper than I usually do. By round 3, I had insights I never would have reached in a normal chat."
> — *Product Manager, Berlin*

> "I've tried Notion AI, Mem, Obsidian plugins. Kinen is the first that feels like actual cognitive augmentation, not just fancy search."
> — *Researcher, London*
