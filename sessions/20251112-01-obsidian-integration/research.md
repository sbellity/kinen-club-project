# Obsidian Research Summary

## Core Features

### Bi-Directional Linking
- Create links between notes using `[[note-name]]` syntax
- Automatic backlinks - when Note A links to Note B, Note B shows Note A in backlinks panel
- Creates a knowledge graph of interconnected ideas
- Supports aliases and link display text

### Graph View
- Visual representation of all notes and their connections
- Interactive - click to navigate, filter by tags/folders
- Helps discover relationships and patterns
- Can be overwhelming with large vaults

### Local Markdown Storage
- All notes stored as plain `.md` files
- No vendor lock-in - files work with any Markdown editor
- Easy version control (Git-friendly)
- Data ownership and privacy (local storage)

### Plugin Ecosystem
Thousands of community plugins including:
- **Templater**: Advanced templates with variables and functions
- **Dataview**: Query notes like a database, create dynamic views
- **Kanban**: Board view for tasks and projects
- **Calendar**: Daily/weekly note views
- **Tag Wrangler**: Enhanced tag management
- **Excalidraw**: Diagramming within notes
- **Tasks**: Task management with due dates, priorities
- **Daily Notes**: Template-based daily note creation

### Cross-Platform Support
- Windows, macOS, Linux (desktop)
- Android, iOS (mobile)
- Optional Obsidian Sync (paid subscription)
- Alternative sync via Git, iCloud, Dropbox, etc.

## Strengths

1. **Data Ownership**: Complete control over your data
2. **Customization**: Highly customizable via themes and plugins
3. **Knowledge Graph**: Visual representation of connections
4. **Portability**: Markdown files work everywhere
5. **Offline-First**: Works without internet connection
6. **Active Community**: Large plugin ecosystem and community support

## Limitations

1. **Learning Curve**: Can be overwhelming for new users
2. **Limited Collaboration**: Primarily individual-focused, no real-time collaboration
3. **Paid Sync**: Obsidian Sync requires subscription (alternatives available)
4. **Performance**: Large vaults with many plugins can be slow
5. **Plugin Management**: Requires maintenance and can have conflicts
6. **No Built-in Publishing**: Requires plugins or external tools for web publishing

## Relevant Use Cases

- Personal knowledge management
- Research and note-taking
- Project documentation
- Writing and content creation
- Task and project management (with plugins)
- Academic research
- Technical documentation

## Comparison to Current Kinen Approach

### Similarities
- Both use Markdown files
- Both support folder structures
- Both are Git-friendly
- Both support frontmatter metadata

### Differences
- Obsidian adds rich interface and navigation
- Obsidian provides linking and graph visualization
- Obsidian has plugin ecosystem
- Current approach is simpler, more minimal
- Current approach is tool-agnostic (any editor works)

## Key Questions for Kinen Integration

1. How would bi-directional linking enhance round-based exploration?
2. Would graph view help visualize session relationships?
3. Which plugins might augment kinen workflows?
4. How does Obsidian handle AI + human collaboration?
5. What are tradeoffs vs current file-based approach?
6. How should methodology adapt to leverage Obsidian?
