## Core Thesis
Human cognitive mechanisms (memory, forgetting, categorization) follow **scale-invariant** laws (power laws). This suggests the underlying mechanisms are "fractal"—operating identically regardless of the timescale.

## Key Concepts for Kinen

### 1. 1/f Noise (Pink Noise) in Memory
Forgetting doesn't happen linearly. It happens on a power law curve.
- We forget most things immediately.
- We remember a few things for a medium time.
- We remember very few things forever.
- **The Insight**: This curve looks *identical* whether you measure it over seconds or years.
- **Kinen Mapping**: Our "Activation Layer" should decay according to a power law, not a linear timer. This mimics biological relevance.

### 2. Universal Categorization
We categorize objects (Dog vs. Cat) the same way we categorize abstract concepts (Freedom vs. Liberty).
- The mechanism of "grouping by similarity" is scale-free.
- **Kinen Mapping**: Our "Graph Substrate" should handle entity clustering the same way for local files as for global concepts.

### 3. Temporal Compression
Memory compresses time logarithmically.
- Yesterday is high-res.
- Last month is medium-res.
- Ten years ago is low-res.
- **Kinen Mapping**: This validates the **LightMem architecture** (Sensory Buffer → Short Term → Long Term). It is an implementation of temporal scale invariance.

## Quote for Session
> "The cognitive system appears to be tuned to the fractal structure of the environment."

**Relevance**: Provides the psychological evidence that human memory is fractal, justifying our decision to build a fractal architecture for AI memory.
