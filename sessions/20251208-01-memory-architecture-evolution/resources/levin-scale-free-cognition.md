## Core Thesis
Cognition is not a property of brains alone. It is a fundamental mechanism of goal-seeking behavior that scales from single cells to tissues, organs, brains, and even swarms. The "logic" of cognition remains the same; only the substrate changes.

## Key Concepts for Kinen

### 1. Scale-Free Cognition
Levin argues that **decision-making processes are invariant to scale**.
- A cell decides to pump ions.
- A tissue decides to form an eye.
- A brain decides to build a tool.
- **Kinen Mapping**: A neural weight decides to update; a user decides to take a note; an organization decides to build a capability. It's the same mechanism.

### 2. The Cognitive Light Cone
This is the **boundary of what a system cares about**.
- **Spatial**: How far away can I sense/act? (Cell: microns. Brain: meters. Org: global.)
- **Temporal**: How far into the future can I predict? (Cell: seconds. Brain: years. Org: decades.)
- **Goal**: Intelligence is the *expansion* of this light cone.
- **Kinen Mapping**: Our goal is to expand the user's cognitive light cone by giving them tools (memory) to predict further in time and connect more distant concepts.

### 3. Bioelectricity as Non-Neural Memory
Memory exists in non-neural substrates. Planaria (flatworms) regenerate their heads and *remember* trained behaviors, even though the brain was cut off. The memory was stored in the bioelectric network of the body.
- **Kinen Mapping**: Proves that memory shouldn't just be in the "brain" (LLM weights). It must exist in the "body" (Graph, Files, Processes).

### 4. Stress as the Driver
Systems minimize "stress" (deviation from a setpoint).
- Stress propagates information. If a cell is stressed, it signals neighbors.
- **Kinen Mapping**: Perplexity/Surprise is our "Stress" signal. It tells the system "we are deviating from prediction, we need to adapt."

## Quote for Session
> "The cognitive self is defined not by its material substrate but by the scale of its goal-seeking loops."

**Relevance**: Validates the "Fractal Memory" architecture where the same logic applies to weights, personal notes, and organizational skills.
