## Core Thesis
Cognition is not bounded by the skin. It is a distributed process that takes place across a system of people, artifacts, and procedures. "Memory" is a property of the system, not the individuals.

## Key Concepts for Kinen

### 1. Computation without a Central Processor
Hutchins showed how a ship navigation team computes location without any single person doing the math.
- The computation "happens" in the interaction between the sailor, the alidade (tool), and the chart.
- **Kinen Mapping**: Kinen's "memory" isn't just the vector DB. It's the interaction between the User, the LLM, the Graph, and the Files.

### 2. Artifacts as Cognitive Buffers
Physical tools (charts, notes) hold information that offloads cognitive load.
- They transform a hard problem (calculate angle) into an easy problem (read number off tool).
- **Kinen Mapping**: Your "Language as Interface" thesis. The Graph is a tool to offload relational memory. The Neural Memory is a tool to offload pattern memory.

### 3. Propagation of Representational State
Information moves through different states (Visual bearing → Spoken number → Written log → Line on chart).
- Each transformation changes the information's properties (easier to store, easier to share, etc.).
- **Kinen Mapping**: This is our "Multimodal Context" idea. We transform memory from Graph → Image or Code → Text to make it usable by the LLM.

## Quote for Session
> "The proper unit of analysis for cognition is not the individual mind, but the cognitive system composed of individuals and their tools."

**Relevance**: Validates the "Macro" layer of your Fractal Memory. Shows how organizational memory ("Skills") emerges from the interaction of components.
