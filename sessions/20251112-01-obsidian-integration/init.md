# Obsidian Integration for Kinen Sessions - Initialization

## Session Goals

1. **Evaluate Obsidian Fit**: Assess whether Obsidian's features align with kinen methodology needs
2. **Identify Advantages**: Map Obsidian's unique capabilities (bi-directional linking, graph view, plugins) to kinen workflows
3. **Surface Limitations**: Understand constraints and tradeoffs of using Obsidian vs current approach
4. **Methodology Adaptation**: Design adjustments to kinen methodology to leverage Obsidian's strengths
5. **Migration Strategy**: If beneficial, outline how to transition existing sessions to Obsidian-native patterns

## Success Criteria

- Clear understanding of Obsidian's capabilities relevant to kinen sessions
- Comprehensive pros/cons analysis with concrete examples
- Proposed methodology adjustments that leverage Obsidian features
- Decision framework for when Obsidian adds value vs when it doesn't
- Concrete recommendations for integration approach (if beneficial)
- Migration path considerations (if applicable)

## Current Context

### What We Know About Obsidian

**Core Features:**
- Bi-directional linking and backlinks (automatic two-way connections)
- Graph view for visualizing note relationships
- Local Markdown file storage (data ownership, portability)
- Extensive plugin ecosystem (thousands of community plugins)
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)
- Offline-first with optional sync (paid Obsidian Sync)

**Key Strengths:**
- Data ownership and privacy (local storage)
- Highly customizable (themes, plugins, workflows)
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Markdown-based (portable, version-control friendly)
- Active community and plugin ecosystem

**Potential Limitations:**
- Steep learning curve
- Limited native collaboration features
- Paid sync required for cross-device sync
- Performance issues with very large databases
- Plugin dependency management complexity

### Current Kinen Methodology

- Round-based iterative refinement (5-6 rounds typical)
- Document-first approach with markdown files
- Inline annotation using `>>` markers
- Living documents (requirements.md, technical-spec.md)
- Frontmatter metadata (date, artifact_type, tags, summary)
- Session folder structure with round files

## Key Questions to Explore

1. How do Obsidian's linking features enhance round-based exploration?
2. Can graph view help visualize session relationships and knowledge evolution?
3. What plugins might augment kinen workflows?
4. How does Obsidian handle collaboration (AI + human)?
5. What are the tradeoffs vs current file-based approach?
6. How would methodology need to adapt to leverage Obsidian?

## Methodology

Using kinen's round-based iterative refinement:
- Round 1: Broad exploration of Obsidian features and fit assessment
- Round 2: Deep dive into specific capabilities (linking, graph, plugins)
- Round 3: Methodology adaptation proposals
- Round 4: Concrete workflow examples and scenarios
- Round 5: Migration considerations and implementation approach
- Round 6: Final recommendations and decision framework (if needed)

## Research Sources

- Obsidian official documentation and features
- Community discussions on knowledge management workflows
- Plugin ecosystem exploration
- Comparison with current kinen file-based approach

## Next Steps

1. Complete Round 1 exploration questions
2. Review responses and identify key areas for deeper investigation
3. Proceed through remaining rounds
4. Produce final recommendations and methodology adjustments
