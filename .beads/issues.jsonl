Should I:\n   A) Implement this new endpoint (requires HTTP server setup)\n   B) Integrate via existing LoadData path (simpler, reuses existing infrastructure)\n   \n   Recommendation: B - reuse existing LoadData infrastructure unless HTTP API is required.\n\n2. PDF library: Handover specifies pdfcpu. Should I:\n   A) Use pdfcpu as specified (github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu)\n   B) Consider alternatives (e.g., rsc.io/pdf for simpler text extraction)\n   \n   Recommendation: A - follow handover spec unless there are known issues.\n\n3. Integration point: How should resources integrate with indexing?\n   A) Extend DataLoader interface to support 'resource' format\n   B) Create separate ResourceLoader that converts to document format\n   C) Direct integration into index builder (bypasses LoadData)\n   \n   Recommendation: B - keeps separation of concerns, resources convert to document format.\n\n4. Missing tasks: Handover mentions 1F.3 (Web clip parser) and 1F.4 (Index builder hook) but these aren't in beads.
